Reflection 1:

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than
keeping all your work local?

When you're working with other people and/or when working with
multiple computers. 

---------------------------------------------------------------

Reflection 2:

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than
having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote
repository?

Pulling changes manually will help us know exactly what is in 
code, and it will not change without us knowing

--------------------------------------------------------------

Reflection 3:

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.
When would you use one instead of another?

Forks - When you're copying the whole repository from one
		user's GitHub to another user's GitHub.
Clones - When you copy a whle repository from the GitHub to a
		local computer, so from GitHub to computer.
Branches - When you're making a change that might add bugs, 
			so new branch is created to make sure the program
			still runs properly.

-------------------------------------------------------------

Reflection 4:

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state
of the remote stored locally?

If it is stored locally, we will always have access to it,
even if offline.
