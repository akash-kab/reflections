Reflection 1:

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than
keeping all your work local?

When you're working with other people and/or when working with
multiple computers.

Reflection 2:

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than
having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote
repository?

Pulling changes manually will help us know exactly what is in 
code, and it will not change without us knowing.
